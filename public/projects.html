                <p>Alzaware: ML Model for early Alzheimer’s diagnosis and risk prediction:<br>
                Alzaware is an AI-powered medical project focused on the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease using MRI scans and machine
                learning. Developed an AI/ML model that analyzes MRI brain scans to predict early-stage Alzheimer’s disease with high reliability.
                Built the complete preprocessing and CNN based detection pipeline, integrating lifestyle data insights for improved diagnostic accuracy</p>

                <p>Alzaware EEG: Analyzing EEG signals to detect cognitive decline<br>
                Led the development of Alzaware EEG is an AI-driven module that analyzes EEG signals to detect early cognitive decline and assess
                Alzheimer’s risk. Developed initial ML models to classify EEG patterns associated with memory impairment, integrating them with the
                existing Alzaware ecosystem. Coordinated research, dataset design, and architecture decisions, ensuring the project aligned with
                medical AI best practices and long-term scalability.</p>

                <p>CatchSense : AI powered fish species detection and weight estimation:<br>
                Developed an AI-powered fish detection and weight estimation system using on-device ML ( EfficientNet ) to assist fishermen with real
                time insights. Led end-to-end pipeline design including image processing, depth fusion, and offline regulatory/NLP modules to support
                sustainable fishing practices.</p>
